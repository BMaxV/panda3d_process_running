# panda3d_process_running
How to run other processes, e.g. other panda3d games, via a panda3d GUI

The example is setup to run the panda3d samples.

For that to work you need to alter the path to point to where you have
saved your panda3d sdk or install or files.

If you want to run different things with it, obviously you need to
put the thing you want to run into the subprocess.call and list
different things on the buttons, etc..
